Seance
======

What it is
----------

Seance is a WebOS app that makes it easy to place calls and send text
messages, through your mobile phone carrier, that appear to come from
your Google Voice number.

What it is not
--------------

This is not a VoIP client. Phone service is required, and calls will
use your airtime minutes.

This project has no association with Google.

History
=======

Seance is a fork of
[P2GoogleVoice](http://www.webosnation.com/p2googlevoice-4),
a product of [P2Labs](http://p2labs.com/) that was abandoned some time
around early 2010.
